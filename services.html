          <img src="./img/programming-language.jpg" alt="" srcset="" />
          <p>
            Programming languages use classes and functions that control
            commands. The reason that programming is so important is that it
            directs a computer to complete these commands over and over again,
            so people do not have to do the task repeatedly. Instead, the
            software can do it automatically and accurately. here we will teach
            diffrent programming languages based on your domain area and your
            intrest
